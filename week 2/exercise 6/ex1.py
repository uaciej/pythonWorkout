Now that you’ve successfully written a translator for a single English word, let’s make
things more difficult: translate a series of English words into Pig Latin. Write a function called pl_sentence that takes a string containing several words, separated by
spaces. (To make things easier, we won’t actually ask for a real sentence. More specifically, there will be no capital letters or punctuation.)
