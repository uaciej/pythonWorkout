'''
Write a function, mysum_bigger_than, that works the same as mysum, except that
it takes a first argument that precedes *args. That argument indicates the
threshold for including an argument in the sum. Thus, calling mysum_bigger
_than(10, 5, 20, 30, 6) would return 50â€”because 5 and 6 arenâ€™t greater than
10. This function should similarly work with any type and assumes that all of the
arguments are of the same type. Note that > and < work on many different types
in Python, not just on numbers; with strings, lists, and tuples, it refers to their
sort order.
