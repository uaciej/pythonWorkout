The land of Faerûn is in turmoil.

Refugees cross the wilds, fleeing the hell torn stronghold of Elturel. A vicious cult marches across the Sword Coast, uniting every race of monsters and men under the banner of a cryptic god they call the Absolute. Chaos strikes at Faerûn's foundations, and none may escape its talons.

Not even you.

The grotesque nautiloid ship appears out of nowhere, blotting out the sun. Its writhing tentacles snatch you from where you stand. The mind flayers have come, imprisoning you on their ship, infecting you with their horrid parasite. You will become one of them.

By fate or fortune, you survive when the nautiloid crashes in the Sword Coast outlands. You set out for civilization, desperate for a cure for the parasite festering in your brain, only to take center stage in a conspiracy that runs as deep as the Nine Hells.

New enemies await.

As for old foes... the shadows stir.
And all roads lead to the legendary city of Baldur's Gate.
