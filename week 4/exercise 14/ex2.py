'''
 Create a dict in which the keys are usernames and the values are passwords,
both represented as strings. Create a tiny login system, in which the user must
enter a username and password. If there is a match, then indicate that the user
has successfully logged in. If not, then refuse them entry. (Note: This is a nice
little exercise, but please never store unencrypted passwords. Itâ€™s a major security risk.)
