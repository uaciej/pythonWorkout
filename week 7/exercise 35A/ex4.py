'''
Itâ€™s sometimes useful to transform data from one format into another. 
Download a JSON-formatted list of the 1,000 largest cities in the United States from
http://mng.bz/Vgd0. Using a dict comprehension, turn it into a dict in which
the keys are the city names, and the values are the populations of those cities.
Why are there only 925 key-value pairs in this dict? Now create a new dict, but
set each key to be a tuple containing the state and city. Does that ensure there
will be 1,000 key-value pairs?
