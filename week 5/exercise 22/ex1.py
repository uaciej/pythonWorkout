'''
For this exercise, create a function, passwd_to_csv, that takes two filenames as
arguments: the first is a passwd-style file to read from, and the second is the name of a
file in which to write the output.
 The new fileâ€™s contents are the username (index 0) and the user ID (index 2).
Note that a record may contain a comment, in which case it will not have anything at
index 2; you should take that into consideration when writing the file. The output file
should use TAB characters to separate the elements
